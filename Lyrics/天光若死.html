“终有一天，你会跨过静谧无声的洗墨江，离开群山环抱的旧桃源，来到无边阴霾的夜空之下。你会目睹无数不可攀爬之山相继倾覆，不可逾越之海干涸成田，你要记得，你的命运悬在刀尖上，而刀尖须得永远向前。”
"One day, you will cross the quiet and silent River for Cleaning Brushes, leave the old Peach Blossom Spring surrounded by mountains, and come to the endless hazy night sky. You will witness countless unclimbable mountains overturning one after another, and the insurmountable sea drying up into fields , You must remember that your destiny hangs on the tip of the broadsword and the tip of the broadsword must always move forward."

“愿你在冷铁卷刃前，得以窥见天光。”
"May you get a glimpse of the sky before the broadsword blade has turned."
